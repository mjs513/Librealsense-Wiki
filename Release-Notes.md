Release Date: 11th Nov 2021

### API Changes
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#version-2500

### What's new
* [#8925](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8925) - **[D400]** Firmware version 5.13.0.50
  - Intermittent failures in sequential Depth start/stop stress-test scenario (DSO-17659)
  - Fix for Emitter on/off stops on RGB srteam deactivates (DSO-16964)
  - Minor fixes and stability improvements
* [#9336](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9336) - **[D400] Self-Calibration (UCAL) Routines - enhancements and refactoring**  
  - UCAL is an advanced feature<sup>(1)</sup> intended to compensate for camera's calibration misalignments developed over the product's life cycle after it's being deployed. The re-calibration is achieved by running a set of predefined routines - On-Chip, Tare and Focal-Length<sup>(2)</sup>, on the Depth camera. Each routine is designed to address specific Camera's metric and to re-adjust it to a level comparable to factory calibration spec.  
   (1) Read the [White Paper](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/self-calibration-for-depth-cameras) prior to running UCAL steps, as it affects the camera's calibration tables.  
   (2) As part of the Self-Calibration refactoring, Focal-Length calibration and Tare Target-based distance calculation were introduced, that require a printed target to be provided ([Target_for_print](https://librealsense.intel.com/Releases/UCAL/Calibration_Target_v1.pdf)).
* [#9831](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9831) - **[Linux]** Switch to OS Event-driven device discovery instead of polling mechanism.
  - Reduce camera reset cycles delays and improves software responsiveness.
  - Replace Linux `polling_device_watcher` with `udev_device_watcher`. More than one udev notification is sent for each add/remove event. We "aggregate" and enumerate only when a polling period comes up "empty" meaning nothing else is incoming. 
  - Utilizes `libudev-dev` package functionality. (LRS-294)
* [#9268](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9268) - **[Docker]**
  - Provide [tutorial](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/scripts/Docker) with a demo docker file to generate and deploy a containerized version of the SDK (LRS-85)
* [#9558](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9558) - **[Demo]** [Pointcloud-Stitching](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/wrappers/pointcloud/pointcloud-stitching).
  - The demo combines Depth live feeds from two cameras and presents a single Wide FOV image.
  - The method used to stitch the images is to transfer both pointclouds into the virtual device's coordinate system and then project them on the virtual device's images.
  - The app assumes the calibration matrix between the devices is known. A method for calculating it is demonstrated in the wrappers\pointcloud\pointcloud-stitching\doc\pointcloud-stitching-demo.md file.
  - The source code is available under `wrapper/pointcloud/pointcloud-stitching/rs-pointcloud-stitching demo` path.

## Release 2.48.0
Release Date: 29th June 2021

### API Changes
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#version-2480

### New Features
* [#8905](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8905) - **Android** - Support Sensor API for streaming  
    - Add sensor open/close/start/stop with callbacks
    - Add callbacks to pipeline API with default and custom configurations
    - Demo apps to use the new APIs
    - Impact to existing API (these are bugs in current implementation and the change should not impact existing apps):
    -  Extend Java class FrameSet from Frame so the frame from pipeline callback can be cast to a set of frames.
    - Add deleter to Java Sensor API with content from old close.  
(DSO-16739, DSO-16740)
* [#8860](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8860) - **[C#]** Example for Pose type stream for T265 device


### Bug Fixes and Enhancements
* [#9219](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9219),[#9159](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/9159),[#9210](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/9210) - **[Core]**  Concurrency & Syncer rework    Following the deadlock that Nir experienced, reworked some stuff (and not all because of the deadlock:
> * split off dispatcher code into dispatcher.cpp
> * syncer (timestamp) inactive stream handling moved into skip_missing_stream
> * syncer identity_matcher names now include the stream index
> * single_consumer_queue::_mutex is now mutable; size() and empty() const
> * revised logic inside single_consumer_queue
> * revised logic inside dispatcher
> * cancellable_time::try_sleep() is now templated, requires actual chrono duration (and not just its ::Rep)
> * syncer stop() calls now percolate recursively to shut down all queues; new syncs do nothing if syncer was stopped
> * add actual matchers to playback device
> * live-test issues with playback
> * added !mayfail to frame-number syncing test for stability
> * added waiting_on<> in utilities/time/waiting-on.h, with unit-test
> * rework dispatcher::flush()  
DSO-16888
* [#9221](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9221) - **[Core]** Fix Memory leak on IMU sensor query (DSO-17238, DSO-17239 )

* [#9207](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9207) - **[Viewer]** Fix crash when opening 'Stereo Module' of a playback

* [#8884](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8884) - **[Examples]** Connect to rs-server and draw frames by means of GPU  
  This sample demonstrates how to connect to remote rs-server over the network and to utilize the GPU for processing of depth frames received from remote camera. This sample is based on rs-gl sample and appears when generating solution by cmake with BUILD_GRAPHICAL_EXAMPLES and BUILD_GLSL_EXTENSIONS flags is ON.  
* [#9185](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9185) - **[L515]** FW version compatibility fix  
L515 FW version prerequisites must be defined with min/max range to avoid cross-product versions reference.
Can be seen as a temporal solution since FW versions may overlap eventually.
Update L515 minimal downgradeable version to 1.5.1.3 instead of 1.4.1.0.  
(RS5-11513), (DSO-16641)

* [#9183](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/9183) - **[Core]** Increase the syncer queue on model-views.h to avoid frame drops.  
This queue stores the output from the syncer, and has to be large enough to deal with slowdowns on the processing / rendering threads of the Viewer, to avoid frame drops.
The problem here wasn't slowdowns of the other thread -- it was bust output from the syncer, too fast for any other thread to deal with and causing drops. The bursts are caused by latency introduced on the USB/FW side when different streams have different FPS.

- Remove options `RS2_OPTION_ENABLE_MAX_USABLE_RANGE` and `RS2_OPTION_ENABLE_IR_REFLECTIVITY` - for now until we will have declaration of them for 0x0b68.  
* [#8979](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8979) - **[L515]** Remove AC.    
Backwards-compatibility is maintained at the level of the C runtime, but not the wrappers or C/C++ compilations:
`rs2_cah_trigger`, for example, was removed -- code using it will not compile.
Likewise, the options for TRIGGER and RESET are still there, but nothing supports them and so they have been removed from most wrappers.
Interfaces like `calibrated_sensor` are still there, but no longer in use.

* [#8896](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8896) - **[CUDA]** Fix unpack from sr300 `CUDA` implementation  
This PR fixes a bug with incorrect depth image on the SR300 series cameras when librealsense is built with CUDA. Addresses [#8897](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/8897)].
The functions `unpack_z16_y8_from_sr300_inzi` and `unpack_z16_y16_from_sr300_inzi` use the source data pointer (`in`) - the first half of the data is bit-shifted and stored in `dest[1]`, the second half is directly copied to `dest[0]`.  
In the CPU version, the pointer is moved in a loop and after its execution it points to `in + count` - so the copying works as it should.  
In the `CUDA` version, the pointer is never moved, so bad data is copied to `dest[0]`, resulting in an incorrect depth image.  
Simply moving the pointer to the right place fixes the problem. ) contributed by [@andrusza2](https://github.com/andrusza2)

This PR is effectively the suggested fix in the GH issue below. Thank you @ankyur.
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/7276 
I've validated the fix works using the following code:
    ```cpp
    // Reproduces T265 Hand on Exit.
    int main(int, char**)
    {
        constexpr std::chrono::seconds timeout{ 1 };
        while (true)
        {
            // Start
            rs2::config config;
            rs2::pipeline pipeline;

            std::cout << "Entering pipeline.start()" << std::endl;
            pipeline.start();
            std::cout << "Exiting pipeline.start()" << std::endl;

            std::cout << "Sleeping for 1 second..." << std::endl;
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(timeout);
            
            std::cout << "Entering pipeline.stop()" << std::endl;
            pipeline.stop();
            std::cout << "Exiting pipeline.stop()" << std::endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }

### Bug Fixes and Enhancements

* [#8289](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8289) - **[DQT] Fix L515 handling in Custom Mode **  
In custom mode we need to update the sensor with sensor mode before start.
* [#8072](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8072) - **[Unity] using SafeHandle in Context class**  
Context class with CriticalFinalizerObject and CER implementation.  
(DSO-13740)
* [#8002](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8002) - **[L515] Remove default preset**  (RS5-8999)
   1. **Remove default preset**
      -  on LRS start up we calculate if we are in one of the presets and if not we are on custom
      - when loading old Json file if the preset is default the preset will be custom
      - if user try to set preset default he will get an error.
   2. **Reading of defaults values** 
      - on new fw versions( >1.5.3.0) is by get_default command
      - on old fw versions its stay as it was - set_current -1 and than get_current gives the defaults values
   3. **update defaults values of hw options on the following cases**
      - on startup 
      - when changing resolution 
      - when changing gain
   4. **Flow of set preset**
      - set gain according to preset
      - read the default values 
      - set default values to currents
      - set laser according to preset

   NOTE: When starting to stream, librealsense may raise an exception:
   > sensor mode (VGA) with RS2_L500_VISUAL_PRESET_CUSTOM is incompatible with the requested profile resolution (XGA)

   This is caused when the visual preset is CUSTOM and the value in RS2_OPTION_SENSOR_MODE does not match the resolution from the profile. Either make 
   sure the preset is one of the predefined ones or set the SENSOR_MODE to match the profile.
   This exception has since been removed, see PR [#8338](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8338).

   - In the Linux backend, the deleter of a `std::unique_ptr` didn't call `delete`;
   - The `hdr_config` type and its sensor were holding mutual shared pointers to each other, causing them to not be deleted;
   - In `synthetic-stream.cpp`, the `on_set` method is called on a `ptr_option`, which stores the function passed to that method. However, the lambda passed captures the shared pointer, giving another shared pointer loop.) contributed by [@Rheel17](https://github.com/Rheel17)

## Release 2.40.0
Release Date: 18 Nov 2020

**Ubuntu 20 LTS and Ubuntu 18 LTS with kernel 5 known issue**:  
We encountered high level of frame drops with several consecutive, compared to Ubuntu16/Kernel 4.  
Streaming Librealsense with Kernel 5 results in a higher frame drop rate that is intensified by consecutive frame drops, mostly between 2-4 frames in a row, reaching 7 frames in certain cases.  
The recurrence rate at which the drops appear is affected by CPU and resources utilization:  
-	For streaming Depth at VGA resolution, the frame drops may occur in intervals of 5-30 min.  
-	Streaming Depth+IR+RGB+IMU the frame drops will appear within 1-3 minutes.  
-	IMU-enabled devices, such as D435i, D455 and L515 encounter higher rate of frame drops compared to D415 and D435.  

Kernel 5 is currently the backbone of Ubuntu 18 and Ubuntu20, thus the issue would affect most users of those versions.  
Note that the frame drops issue is confirmed in Ubuntu LTS 18 and 20, and it does not affect Ubuntu16 with LTS kernel 4.4.  

<ins>Mitigation Plan and Alternatives</ins>  
Realsense support team is working to resolve the issue on SDK and OS levels, and while the investigation is ongoing, one recommended method to mitigate this is by compiling and running Librealsense SDK with RSUSB backend - 
(`cmake .. -DFORCE_RSUSB_BACKEND`).  
The main limitation of RSUSB backend is that it is not suited for multi-cam scenarios. But whenever applicable - using RSUSB backend allows to bypass the Video4Linux kernel APIs and communicate with the device using generic USB driver.  
Switching to RSUSB backend provides a mitigating for sequential frame drops.

## Release 2.39.0
Release Date: 1 Oct 2020

### API Changes
https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#version-2390


### New Features
* [#7453](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/7453) - **D4xx Firmware - v5.12.8.200** 
  - **Important: the firmware is intended to be used with SDK v2.39.0(+) and is not compatible with the previous Librealsense releases**
  - Add RGB stream from Left IR imager (D455).
  - HDR Functionality for D400 Depth sensors
* [#7466](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/7466) - **L515 Firmware -  v1.5.1.3**  
  - Support for USB2
  - Support QVGA resolution
  - Controls and stability improvements

* [#6916](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/6916) - **[D455] Add synthetic RGB from left imager**
* [#7205](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/7205) - **[Android] Enable USB weak host workaround to improve android stability**  
Enable L515 android stability workaround. Current USB buffer settings in device require large number of small USB transactions from device to USB host controller, some hosts with relatively weak host cannot handle this many transactions quickly, results in stability issues, camera disappear from os enumeration or one of the streams dies during stream, etc. This workaround uses larger buffer settings to reduce the number of transaction and improve performance and stability.
Workaround is enabled by default for all android platforms. Requires additional firmware command support in new firmware release.
(RS5-8011)
* [#7354](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/7354) - **Depth HDR Functionality (Alpha Release)** 
A new Depth enhancement feature implemented in both Host and the Device Firmware that allows to improve Depth data in adverse light conditions by merging data from consecutive frames.
At its core the feature allows to configure and run Depth and IR stream with per-frame specified exposure and gain values (sequence of 2 frames). Dedicated metadata attributes allow to associate the arriving frames with the configuration established by user.  
When arrived on host a specially-designed `Merge` processing block shall be utilized to fuse depth data from the incoming frames.
Additionally a `Filtered Id` processing block is provided that allows to forward Depth and IR frames that correspond to even/odd frames of the sequence.  
The feature is integrated with `Realsense-Viewer` application via a set of dedicated controls and post-processing blocks.  
It is an Alpha release, and will be followed by a White Paper for in-depth presentation and usage guidance.

  - Controls and stability improvements
  

### Bug Fixes and Enhancements
* [#6150](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/6150) - **global_timestamp_reader: no blocking.**.  Prevent calls for get_device_time_ms from frame thread. Continue system_time-hw_time equation through time loop.
* [#7017](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/7017) - **Fix reporting distance with SW device**  (DSO-15441)
* [#6933](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/6933) - **Release CComPtr cause to access violation** 
* [#6926](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/6926) - **Fw logger bug fix**.  Fixing timestamp in new fw logger message (DSO-15394) 
* [#6945](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/6945) - **Android stability fixes** -  Camera app performance/stability issues:
1. fix pipe.stop() issues
   a) problem: null pointer segfault
       cause: thread synchronization in dispatcher
       fix: add additional lock in invoke_and_wait.
  b) problem: invalid address segfault in uvc_streamer, active_object, dispatcher flows
      cause: double release of memory in destructors due to synchronization issue in watchdog, active_object, dispatcher, and primarily uvc_streamer.
      fix: add additional state check and synchronization.
  c) problem: invalid address segfault in pipeline flows
     cause: double release of memory in pipeline destructor to stop pipeline twice, the extra stop come from JNI code when handle is deleted and invokes destructor which tries to run stop() again.
     fix: do shared pointer reset when profile active (also this is when they are initialized).
   d) problem: invalid address segfault at various points depends on workload
      cause: uvc_streamer shared pointers cleared at the wrong time, not cleared when stream stopped, so it tries to stop the streamer a second time during destruction
      fix: destroy uvc_streamers after stream is stopped and no active profiles
   e) problem: invalid address segfault in device info destructor through JNI stack
       cause: appears to be double releasing as JNI stack references the pointer
       fix: avoid delete in JNI, need to confirm it's released on native stack.
2. problem: invalid address segfault related to stream profiles
   cause: profile data array copy in JNI, jlong is 64-bit but pointer could be 32-bit, should not xcopy the entire buffer
   fix: copy array elements
3. problem: invalid address segfault related to query sensors
   cause: sensor data array copy in JNI, jlong is 64-bit but pointer could be 32-bit, should not xcopy the entire buffer
   fix: copy array elements
4. problem: camera app performance degradation and stability issues after repeated device disconnect/connect
   app cannot recover if device disconnected in middle of starting streaming
   cause: activity operations executed multiple times due to activity instances and sequence issue
   fix: create single activity instance, manage its creation and destruction, and correct sequence.

        **Options:**  
        - confidence,  
        - post_processing_sharpness ,  
        - pre_processing_sharpness ,

* [#5584](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/5584) - **log_to_callback + unit-tests**:  
Fixes OpenVino test-cases in static (non-shared) builds.  
Fixes some of the warnings repeatedly given (from headers) during compilation.  
Travis "Linux - cpp" build is now "Linux - cpp - static" and uses static (non-shared; BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is off) compilation.  
Added unit-testing mechanism:
  - Any test-\*.cpp (and, in future, test-*.py, etc.) under unit-tests/ is a unit-test
  - Tests can be nested inside directories
  - Each test creates its own project (in Visual Studio under Unit-Tests, with same nested structure)   and thus its own executable
  - A script (unit-tests/run-unit-tests.py) runs all unit-tests and exits with status 1 or 0
  - Unit-tests can be specifically shared or static
- Unit-tests are now run in Travis, in both shared and static builds
- BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is now a compiler definition, too
- Added rs2::log_to_callback, rs2_log_to_callback, rs2_log_to_callback_cpp
  - Minimum level can be set for a callback (e.g., warnings and above)
  - Added RS2_LOG_SEVERITY_ALL, same as _DEBUG, so it's easier to say "log all messages"
  - 21 unit-tests under unit-tests/log/

* [#5751](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/5751) - **Linux Kernel 5 and 5.3 fixes and enhancements** (DSO-14299):  
 - Fixes:
    - UVC and metadata node matching shall use non-lexicographic sort in v4l. Applicable for kernels 4.16+.  
   - Enforce Video/Metadata sync by using two-stage blocking calls. This replaces I/O multiplexing to ensure the pairing of video and meta nodes payloads.  
   - Check libusb return value to prevent null de-referencing and segfault.  
   - Enforce Metadata  polling is performed when invalid video buffer is encountered to ensure Video/Metadata node sync.
   - Fix hardware fps calculation when the frame number being reset internally by the FW, such as in `SCP Overflow` case.  
 - Enhancements:
   - Make unified kernel patches for LTS v5.0 and v5.3.
   - Re-enable unattended patch by overriding `patch --merge` inconsistency with try/apply. Github [#5710](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/5710)
   - Adjust metadata validation heuristics in SKU-neutral manner to allow for D400, SR300 and L500 md payloads.
   - Check  Metadata/Video nodes buffers synchronization by comparing the kernel sequence buffers
- Addresses [#5319](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/5319), [#4543](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/4543).

## Release 2.30.0
Release Date: 4 Nov 2019

### API Changes
[link](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/wiki/API-Changes#version-2300)

### New Features & Improvements
* [#4975](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/4975) - New Cross-platform user-space implementation for supported USB protocols named `rsusb`. The refactored classes replace the multiplicity of UVC device per-platform implementations (Windows, Unix, Android) with a single cross-platform code infrastructure.
  In order to support the UVC device requirements, some modification were introduced into `rsusb` API, mainly adding asynchronous API to the USB messenger.
  Core Features:
  - Asynchronous API added to `rsusb` (USB request).
  - Multiple implementations of libuvc (Win7 / Linux / Android) replaced with single implementation
  - HID device modified to work with the new asynchronous API.
  Impact:
  - A new CMake option named `FORCE_RSUSB_BACKEND` added replaces the `FORCE_LIBUVC` and `FORCE_WINUSB_UVC` flags are now marked as deprecated. 
  - An update to WinUSB driver was implemented. **Important** - The new driver must be installed in order to use librealsense 2.30.0 or newer SDK version on Windows 7. Installation of the new driver is performed via [librealsense Windows 7 installer](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases/download/v2.30.0/Intel.RealSense.SDK-WIN7-2.30.0.1174.exe).

* librealsense CI now includes recorded test cases for the 4 major supported lines of devices - SR300, D415, D435 and other engineering models (DSO-7101)
* New example added showcasing the [Sensor API](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/sensor-control) (DSO-7016)
* Set of new examples added showcasing working with [C API](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/tree/master/examples/C) (DSO-6909)
* Added Python example for working with [D400 Advanced Mode](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/wrappers/python/python-rs400-advanced-mode-example.py) (DSO-7287)
* Added depth colorization options to the Viewer (and the API) (DSO-7150)

### Bug Fixes
* **[Firmware]** When Advance Mode is changed, the camera requires sometimes to disconnect/reconnect (DSO-7015)
* Pipeline fails to choose the correct device when several devices are connected (DSO-7366)
* When requesting 2 streams (such as color and depth) only one frameset is returned in the pipeline, instead of the 2 synchronized streams. (DSO-7202)

### Known Issues
* **[Viewer]** OpenGL tools and samples don't work with some types of Docking Stations(ThinkPad USB3.0 Pro) (DSO-6674)
* Windows - device disconnect events are sometimes not reported (DSO-6813)
* Windows - Soft stability issue: start-stop test hangs when RGB and Depth running together after hundreds of cycles (DSO-6930)
* Changing the gain value while Auto Exposure (AE) is enabled disables AE, this requires manually enabling AE (DSO-6853)
* GUI - The Output Viewer window doesn't show the bottom notifications (DSO-7197)
* Linux - When using IR format that is different than UYVY, the FPS drops to half (DSO-7183)

### Limitations
* **[Firmware]** Sometimes when RGB and Stereo resolutions are at FHD-HD, the RGB camera streaming stops and doesn't return even after turning the Depth Stereo to Off (DSO-6894)
